**NOTE: THIS IS A FORK OF https://github.com/tlsnotary/pagesigner-cli**

**This module was not really configured to be included into a project, so I've added some to the package.json to
make it easier to include as a github repo in a npm module, but I will not be publishing this to npm.**

## For new releases

- Check out the updated branch from https://github.com/tlsnotary/pagesigner-cli (add it as a git remote to make things easier) using the clone command below.
- run the following to remove the gitlink entry created for the submodules:
```mv pagesigner pagesigner_tmp && git submodule deinit pagesigner && git rm --cached pagesigner && mv pagesigner_tmp pagesigner && git add pagesigner```
- Remove all .gitmodule / .git files from any gitmodules that were included.
- push to branch with current date and tag

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------//
Update May 2022: We are actively working on a TLSNotary implementation in Rust here:
https://github.com/tlsnotary/tlsn/
When the Rust implementation is ready, it will replace this nodejs-based tool.
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------//

pgsg-node.js allows you to run PageSigner with nodejs >= v 16.5.0

Clone this repo with:
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tlsnotary/pagesigner-cli
Install dependencies by running inside the pagesigner-cli directory:
npm ci



Usage: ./pgsg-node.js <command> [arguments]

where <command> is one of notarize, verify

Examples:

./pgsg-node.js notarize example.com --headers headers.txt
Notarize example.com using HTTP headers from headers.txt
The most basic headers file can look like this:

GET /r/worldnews/ HTTP/1.1
Host: www.reddit.com

./pgsg-node.js verify imported.pgsg
Verify a Pagesigner session from imported.pgsg. This will create a session directory with the decrypted cleartext and the copy of the pgsg file.
